<h5><ul>
  <li>The email is in your spam folder. (Sometimes things get lost in there.)</li>
  <li>The email address you entered had a mistake or typo. (Happens to the best of us.)</li>
  <li>You accidentally gave us another email address. (Usually a work or personal one instead of the one you meant.)</li>
  <li>We can’t deliver the email to this address. (Usually because of corporate firewalls or filtering.)</li>
</ul></h5>
